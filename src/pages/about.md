# Welcome to my gamedev realm!

I'm Alexander, aka ATH, a former culinary maestro turned software sorcerer on a quest to craft immersive digital worlds. With 12 years of wielding spatulas in the culinary cosmos and now three years of weaving code spells, my journey has taken an exhilarating turn into game development.

Here, amidst lines of code and a symphony of pixels, I chronicle my adventure—from conceptual sparks to pixelated realities. As a devout collector of comics, tabletop game figurines, and an avid explorer of D&D realms, my creative concoctions draw inspiration from diverse passions.

This blog serves as a treasure trove of devlogs, behind-the-scenes escapades, triumphs, setbacks, and the enchanting alchemy that births a game. Join me on this odyssey; let's embark on an immersive journey where coding meets storytelling and pixels shape dreams into interactive realities.

Buckle up for an exhilarating ride through the intricate tapestry of game development—it's a collision of passions, a tale of creativity, and a celebration of community. Thank you for joining me on this epic quest!
