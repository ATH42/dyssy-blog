## Introduction: A Surprising Question, An Unexpected Journey

A few weeks ago, a simple message in our group chat caught me off guard:

`Alex, could you imagine programming a game?`
It was unexpected, to say the least.

But that seemingly innocuous question stirred something within me. Suddenly, I realized the time had arrived. I needed to start making a game. Perhaps all I needed was someone to believe I could do it.

Time isn't and hopefully never will be a concern; it matters much less than the drive to embark on this new endeavor. The last time I felt this passionate about something was when Io was born, a moment that propelled drastic changes. That same spark now reignites within me.

## The Passion Ignited

It's incredible how a single question can be a catalyst for transformation. From that moment, I plunged into learning Unity, exploring C#, and establishing a presence on various platforms - Kofi, YouTube, a blog, Twitch - seeking to document this newfound journey.

I want to emphasize that setting up those platforms and social media was more random than knowing what their exact purpose should be or evolve into. I guess I will paint a clearer picture for myself as I go. Perhaps I will drop some of them or even expand on them for reasons that are not clear to me at this point in time.

Itâ€™s been a whirlwind of excitement and uncertainty.

## The Self-Doubt Within

Yet, amidst this whirlwind, I find myself consistently second-guessing. Doubts creep in, questioning whether I'm on the right path, whether I'm doing things correctly. It's a relentless battle between the passion driving me forward and the self-doubt that threatens to hold me back.

## Embracing the Challenge

But here's what keeps me going: the commitment to doing this right, to doing it professionally, not knowing what will come of it and tending to a childhood dream of mine. The past few weeks have been a frenzy of learning Unity and C#, navigating Aseprite, and documenting every step.

It's been crazy, but I'm determined.
